# About

Un-accents and un-umlauts characters in a string. Also preliminary converts the string to lower
case. We use it for autocomplete: both for the matched strings -- on the server side, when indexing;
and for the strings the user types into a text input in the browser.

Has nothing to do with [Unicode Normalization](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/), but rather
expects the passed strings being already Unicode-normalized.

# Installation

## Under Node.js

    $ npm install --save normalize-for-search

then

    var normalizeForSearch = require('normalize-for-search');

## In CouchDB

Just drop the `src/normalize.js` contents into your CouchDB design document -- for example, into
`{views: {lib: {normalize: 'JSON-ENCODED src/normalize.js CODE HERE'}}}`, and then `require` it
elsewhere:

    var normalizeForSearch = require('views/lib/normalize');

## In the browser, with AngularJS

    $ bower install --save normalize-for-search

then

    <script src="/components/normalize-for-search/src/normalize.js"></script>

    <script>
        var injector = angular.injector(['normalizeForSearch']);
        injector.invoke(function (normalizeForSearchFilter) { ... });
    </script>

    <p>{{ text | normalizeForSearch }}</p>

Thus, the Angular module `normalizeForSearch` declares a filter function available both in the
HTML partials, and in the controllers' code.

# API

    normalizeForSearch('Dät ist naïve und ÜBERCOOL, ё-маё!');
    // Results in 'dat ist naive und ubercool, е-мае!'
